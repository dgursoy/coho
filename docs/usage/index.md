# Using Coho

The logic of Coho involves describing the components of a holography setup and the experiment states, and then running the simulation to acquire data. The following steps describe the process:

## Key Topics

* **[Configuration Guide:](configuration.md)** Configuration options and management
* **[Component Definitions:](components/index.md)** Define the components in the simulation
* **[Experiment Definitions:](experiment/index.md)** Define the experiment states
* **[Runtime Operations:](runtime/index.md)** Define runtime operations for the simulation (or reconstruction)

Each topic is covered in detail in its respective section. Start with [Quick Start](../quickstart.md) if you're new to coded holography or the Coho package before diving into the details.

Also, check out the [Examples](../examples/index.md) section to see practical applications and analysis workflows.
