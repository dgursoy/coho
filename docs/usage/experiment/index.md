# Experiment Definitions

We define an **[Experiment](./states.md)** as a sequence of states, with each state representing the configuration of the system's components during a specific data acquisition step. For example, an experiment might involve capturing a series of holograms at different sample positions or using varying illumination wavelengths. Each such configuration corresponds to a distinct state within the experiment.
