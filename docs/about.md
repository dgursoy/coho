# About Coho

Coho is a Python-based platform designed for flexible and extensible imaging experiments. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for modeling, simulating, and analyzing imaging systems. It is built on top of [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a library for high-performance numerical computing with an emphasis on scientific computing and research-oriented workflows. 

## Why Coho?

Coho bridges the gap between scientific rigor and practical usability, making it the ideal platform for advanced imaging experiments. Its design emphasizes flexibility, scalability, and collaboration across disciplines.

* **Unified Framework**:
A single codebase for diverse imaging systems, reducing redundancy.

* **Modularity and Collaboration**:
Extendable architecture supports teamwork without requiring expertise across all disciplines.

* **Ease of Maintenance**:
JAX-based modular design ensures scalable, intuitive, and easily updatable code.

## Why JAX?

We use [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for its unique combination of performance, flexibility, and ease of use. Here’s why:

* **Functional and Modular**:
JAX emphasizes pure functions, ensuring clean, testable, and research-friendly code.

* **Performance with JIT**:
`jit` compiles computations into efficient machine code at runtime, boosting performance.

* **Elegant Vectorization**:
`vmap` simplifies batch processing, reducing manual loops and boilerplate.

* **Scientific Focus**:
Native support for FFTs, complex numbers and scientific computing makes JAX ideal for research.

* **Composability**:
Primitives like `grad`, `jit`, and `vmap` enable intuitive construction of complex workflows.

* **Hardware Acceleration**:
Seamlessly supports CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, making scaling easy.

* **Parallel Processing**:
`pmap` facilitates parallel and distributed computation for large-scale tasks.

* **Expanding Ecosystem**:
Libraries like [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/haiku) (neural networks) and [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax) (optimization) extend JAX’s versatility.
