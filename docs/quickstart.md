# Quick Start

## Prerequisites

- Coho package installed (see [installation guide](installation.md#installation))
- Familiarity with [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming 
- Basic understanding of optical physics and wave propagation

## Basic Usage

Coho enables users to design custom imaging setups. Users can define both the components of imaging systems such as wavefronts, optical elements like apertures, samples in the beam path, and detectors, as well as components of the reconstruction process such as cost functions and solvers. 

## Example
