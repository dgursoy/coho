# Components

A typical coded holography setup consists of four key components:

- [**Wavefront**](./wavefront.md) is a 2D cross-section of a 3D wave propagating through space between the source and the detector. It is described by the complex wave field, which represents the wave's amplitude and phase at a specific plane. 

- [**Aperture**](./aperture.md) is an optical element that encodes the reference wavefront by modifying its amplitude and phase. This modification is described by a complex transmission function, determined by the aperture's material properties, such as composition, density, thickness, and the energy of the incident wave. 

- [**Sample**](./sample.md) represents the object of interest in the holography setup. It also modifies the incident wavefront via a complex transmission function, influenced by the sample's physical and material properties.

- [**Detector**](./detector.md) records the intensity of the wavefront at the detector plane, capturing the interference pattern created by the interaction of the reference and object wavefronts.
