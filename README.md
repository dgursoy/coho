## Features

- **Wave Propagation Models**: Supports Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction, with the flexibility to add custom propagation methods.
- **Material Properties Calculation**: Utilizes `xraylib` to compute complex refractive indices and attenuation coefficients.
- **Pattern Generation**: Includes functions for creating binary coded apertures and object patterns.
- **Detector Simulation**: Models realistic detector responses, including noise and efficiency variations.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides functions to visualize wavefronts, intensities, and propagation animations.
- **Configurable Simulation Pipeline**: Allows users to define simulation components and parameters via YAML configuration files.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize for specific research needs.

### Installing from PyPI

COHO can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`:

```bash
pip install coho
```

This command will install COHO along with all required dependencies.

### Installing from Source

To install COHO from the source code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dgursoy/coho.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with COHO:

1. **Create a Simulation Configuration File**:

   Save the following YAML content as `config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   simulation:
     name: "Example Simulation"
     elements:
       - type: "wavefront"
         name: "source"
         parameters:
           energy: 8.0  # keV
           pixels: 512
           pixel_size: 1e-6  # cm
           type: "plane"
       - type: "component"
         name: "coded_aperture"
         position: 10.0  # cm
         material: "Gold"
         thickness: 2.0  # Î¼m
         parameters:
           type: "coded_aperture"
           pattern:
             bit_size: 64
             rotation_angle: 15
             seed: 42
       - type: "detector"
         name: "detector"
         position: 50.0  # cm
         parameters:
           normalize: True
           incident_intensity: 1000
   ```

2. **Create a Simulation Script**:

   Save the following Python code as `run_simulation.py`:

   ```python
   import sys
   import coho

   def main(config_file):
       # Load the configuration
       config = coho.load_configuration(config_file)

       # Validate the configuration
       coho.validate_config(config)

       # Initialize the simulation
       simulation = coho.Simulation(config)

       # Run the simulation
       simulation.run()

       # Access results (e.g., detected intensity)
       detected_intensity = simulation.results.get('detected_intensity')

       # Visualize the detected intensity
       if detected_intensity is not None:
           coho.plot_intensity(detected_intensity, title='Detected Intensity')

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       if len(sys.argv) != 2:
           print("Usage: python run_simulation.py <config_file.yml>")
           sys.exit(1)
       config_file = sys.argv[1]
       main(config_file)
   ```

3. **Run the Simulation**:

   ```bash
   python run_simulation.py config.yml
   ```

   This will execute the simulation based on the configuration file and display the detected intensity.
