# Using Coho

This section is to guide you through using Coho.

## Key Topics

* **[Basic Concepts:](basics.md)** Understand coded holography principles and Coho's implementation
* **[Working with Apertures:](apertures.md)** Create and manipulate coding patterns and apertures
* **[Sample Modeling:](elements.md)** Learn about built-in sample types and how to create your own
* **[Detector Setup:](detector.md)** Understand how to configure and use detectors in Coho
* **[Simulation Pipeline:](simulation.md)** Set up and run holography simulations
* **[Configuration Guide:](configuration.md)** Customize Coho for your needs

Each topic is covered in detail in its respective section. Start with [Basic Concepts](basics.md) if you're new to coded holography or the Coho package.

Also, check out the [Examples](../examples/index.md) section to see practical applications and analysis workflows.
