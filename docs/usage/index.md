# Using Coho

Coho is designed to be flexible and extensible. Users can define their own components and experiments. It involves understanding 

## Key Topics

* **[Waves:](waves.md)** Wave objects and their properties
* **[Operators:](operators.md)** Operators for wave propagation, interaction, and manipulation

Each topic is covered in detail in its respective section. Start with [Quick Start](../quickstart.md) if you're new to coded holography or the Coho package before diving into the details.

Also, check out the [Examples](../examples/index.md) section to see built-in pipelines.
